The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;

The "%" sign is used to define wildcards (missing letters) both before and after the pattern. 

's%' means City name starts with s.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 's%';



'%s' means City name ends with s.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%s';

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a Country containing the pattern "land":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country LIKE '%land%';

Using the NOT keyword allows you to select records that do NOT match the pattern.
The following SQL statement selects all customers with Country NOT containing the pattern "land":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT LIKE '%land%';
